          <h2><span class="sec-num">4</span> Payments &amp; Fees</h2>

          <h3>Pricing</h3>
          <p>All fees are outlined in the applicable Service Agreement or Proposal. Prices are quoted in US Dollars (USD) unless otherwise stated. We reserve the right to revise our pricing at any time, with changes communicated in advance and applying only to new or renewed agreements.</p>

          <h3>Payment Terms</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>One-time projects</strong> — a deposit of 50% is required before work commences; the remaining balance is due upon project completion and before final files are delivered.</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly retainer services</strong> — invoiced at the beginning of each billing cycle and due within 7 days of invoice date.</li>
            <li><strong>Rush fees</strong> — projects requiring expedited turnaround may be subject to an additional rush fee, agreed upon in advance.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Late Payments</h3>
          <p>Payments not received by the due date may result in a suspension of services until the outstanding balance is settled. Kavyro Solutions reserves the right to charge a late payment fee of 1.5% per month on overdue balances.</p>

          <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
          <p>Deposits are non-refundable once work has commenced. If a project is cancelled by the client after work has begun, you are responsible for payment for all work completed up to the cancellation date. Completed and delivered work is non-refundable.</p>

          <div class="warn-box">
            <p>⚠️ For ongoing retainer services, a minimum 14-day written notice is required for cancellation. Services will continue and be billed during the notice period.</p>

            <li><strong>Standard plans</strong> include up to 2 rounds of revisions per deliverable.</li>
            <li><strong>Premium plans</strong> include unlimited revisions within the agreed scope.</li>
            <li>Revisions requested beyond the included rounds will be charged at our standard hourly rate.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Approval &amp; Sign-Off</h3>
          <p>Upon delivery of a final draft or completed deliverable, you will be requested to provide written approval (via email or project management tool). Once approved, additional changes will be treated as new revision requests and may incur additional fees.</p>
          <p>If no feedback is received within 5 business days of delivery, the deliverable will be deemed approved and the project marked as complete.</p>
