# Docs

The why behind the site. `README.md` at the root says what the site is,
`AGENTS.md` says how to make a change, `CLAUDE.md` maps the files. This folder
records the decisions those files take for granted, so nobody has to dig
through git history to learn why a rule exists.

Open this folder as an Obsidian vault, or read it on GitHub. Links are plain
relative markdown links, which work in both. Paths like `assets/...` mean the
file inside `public/`, the website folder.

## Decisions

One note per decision, numbered in the order they were made. A decision is
never edited to say something else: write a new note that supersedes it and
mark the old one `Superseded by`.

## Adding a note

Copy [the template](decisions/_template.md) to the next number, fill it in,
link it from the related notes and add a row above. Write one when a change
sets a rule others must follow, picks between real alternatives, or would make
someone ask "why is it like this?" later. Routine fixes and copy edits do not
need one; the commit message is enough.
